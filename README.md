# What is this?
This is a simple profile embed for Bluesky.

# How do I use this?
Add a new iframe with transparency on and set its source to 

\[NOT DONE YET\]?actor=\<handle of the profile you want\>

Easy, right??

# Where can I use this?
If you can have cross-origin iframes with Javascript, you can have this!

This is ideal for a static site, like Neocities, Nekoweb, or GitHub Pages. I mention this because that's *why* this exists; see [my site!](pacomatic1.github.io)
